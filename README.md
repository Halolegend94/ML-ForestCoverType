# ML Project: Forest Cover Type Classification

The objective of this work is to develop and compare different models of a phenomenon using machine learning techniques. In particular, the interest lays in predicting the forest cover type of a region given certain characteristics of the soil and ambient.

In order to do so, large dataset of 581012 instances is provided, where each instance is an observation of a 30 X 30 meter cell characterized by 54 attributes and associated with the correct class of forest cover type. The 54 columns of data are divided as follows: 10 quantitative variables, 4 binary wilderness areas and 40 binary soil type variables.
